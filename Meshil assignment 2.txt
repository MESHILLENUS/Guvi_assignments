1.Difference between Document vs Window objects

The document object represents the content of the web page, while the window object represents the browser window itself.
document is a property of the window object, meaning it's accessible as window.document or simply document.
Manipulating the document object affects the content and structure of the loaded page, while manipulating the window object affects the browser environment and its behavior.
document provides methods and properties for interacting with HTML elements and the DOM structure, whereas window provides methods and properties for controlling the browser window and its interactions.
