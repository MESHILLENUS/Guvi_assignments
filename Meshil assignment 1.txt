1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2


 HTTP/1.1 has served as the backbone of the World Wide Web for many years, HTTP/2 represents a significant evolution in web communication protocols. With features such as multiplexing, header compression, server push, stream prioritization, and a binary protocol, HTTP/2 offers improved performance, reduced latency, and enhanced user experience. As web technology continues to evolve, HTTP/2 provides a solid foundation for building faster, more efficient, and more responsive web applications.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects play a central role in JavaScript programming, providing a flexible and powerful way to organize and manipulate data. Understanding the internal representation of objects, including properties, methods, prototype chains, hidden classes, and memory representation, is essential for writing efficient and maintainable JavaScript code. By mastering the intricacies of objects in JavaScript, developers can unlock the full potential of the language and build robust and scalable applications.

4.Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address

IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):

An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network.
It serves two primary purposes: host identification and location addressing.
There are two main versions: IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit).
Port:

A port is a communication endpoint used by computers to identify specific processes or services on a network.
Ports are identified by numbers ranging from 0 to 65535, with well-known ports (0-1023) reserved for specific services.
HTTP Methods (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Methods):

HTTP methods, or HTTP verbs, are standardized request types used by clients to communicate with web servers.
Common HTTP methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE, each serving different purposes in web communication.
MAC Address (Media Access Control Address):

A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on a physical network segment.
MAC addresses are typically expressed as six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by colons or hyphens.
They are used at the data link layer of the OSI model to uniquely identify devices on Ethernet networks.
